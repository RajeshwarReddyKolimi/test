## Steps followed

- Forked repository from Vashishta's github repo: https://github.com/vashistavallambhatla/test.
- Cloned the forked repository to my local space.
- Made changes to readme.md file and pushed the changes back to my remote repo.
- Then created a pull request to Vashishta's repo and he accepted.
- Repeated the same process again, but this time Vashista made changes to the repo and I made the changes and created a merge conflict.
- Then found what is the conflict and proceeded with the changes required.
- Created a pull request which is now without merge conflicts and he accepted the request.
